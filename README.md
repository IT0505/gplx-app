## This project is just Frontend of our website.
You need our [Backend](https://github.com/IT0505/gplx-app-be) project to run full website on localhost.

## How to run this project on localhost
- After download and extract, you need to open `gplx-app/api/axiosClient.js` file and change value of `PORT` to match with the `PORT` you run our [Backend](https://github.com/IT0505/gplx-app-be) on if it isn't match.

- Then you just need to type in the terminal _(navigate terminal to the folder contains README.md file)_ following command:  
`npm install` and wait for the library installed then type following command:  
`npm run dev` and the project will run on `http://localhost:3000` _(on default setting)_
